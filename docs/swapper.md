## What is Face Swapper for?

Icons8 Face Swapper is a tool that lets you both combine and swap faces and bodies on photos using artificial intelligence. For example, you can use it fo:
* face swapping just for fun;
* making your online identity less recognizable by combining your photos with generated appearances;

## Uploading

To upload a picture to Face Swapper you can either pick one through your system's file explorer or drag and drop it onto the uploading area.

</p>

The tool supports uploading images from clipboard, to do that just press <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/ctrlbut.png"> **+** <img align="center" height="47" src="/public/vkey.png"> while the tool is open.

:information_source: Please keep in mind the file requirements: Face Swapper accepts **.png** and **.jpg** up to **5 Mb**.

## Swapping faces and bodies

After uploading an image to Face Swapper, you will see several controls for each image. You can either use a photo of a single person or a group photo. The tool works with both.

<p align="center">
  <img height="600" src="/public/fsexample.png">
</p>

<img align="center" height="50" src="/public/facebut1.png"> will let you pick either a similar AI-generated face, face of a model from our photostock, a meme template or a celebrity or upload your own photo. This option also lets you choose a background from our Moose photo library and upload your own backgrounds.

</p>

<img align="center" height="50" src="/public/bodybut.png"> works very similar to the previous option. First you pick a face, then you pick a body to move the face to.

* <img align="center" height="60" src="/public/fsshare3.png"> lets you copy the link to the swapping result, post it on Facebook and Twitter or send it via WhatsApp and email.
* <img align="center" height="60" src="/public/fsenhance3.png"> lets you upload the result into AI Smart Upscaler or AI Background Remover.

## FAQ and common cases

**Q:** The result doesn't fully resemble the people I swapped.<br>
**A:** Face Swapper doesn't strictly swap faces around by copypasting them. It generates a face that would be somewhere in between the source and target, similar to both.

**Q:** I have uploaded images, but they've been stuck in the queue for several minutes. <br>
**A:** We recommend waiting, but if you believe your images got lost in the queue, please contact our support.

**Q:** Is there a limit for batch uploads? <br>
**A:** There are no limits for batch uploads, but you should keep in mind that the more images you upload, the bigger the performance hit will be. For really large uploads, please consider getting an API subscription.

**Q:** I bought a prepaid pack, but didn't receive my order. <br>
**A:** If you didn't have an Icons8 account while buying the pack, the system will automatically create one with the billing email used during checkout and offer you to set up a password. If you missed that window, you will have to request a password change for the account. If you still need help with your order, please contact our support team.
